🚗 Creating an Excel-based Road Accident Dashboard: Unveiling Insights for 2021 & 2022 📊

I have developed a comprehensive Road Accident Dashboard for 2021 and 2022 using Excel. I aim to unlock crucial insights, including:
🔹 Total Casualties: 417,883
🔹 Casualties by Vehicle Type
🔹 Casualties by Road Type & Surface
🔹 Monthly Trend: Current Year vs Previous Year

🔹 Primary KPI - Post-Accident Casualties
🔹 Casualties Percentage Based on Severity
🔹 Maximum Casualties by Vehicle Type

🔹 Secondary KPI - Total Casualties per Vehicle Type
🔹 Monthly Trend for Current & Previous Year
🔹 Casualties Differentiated by Day/Night
🔹 Filter Panel for Accurate Data Access
🔹 Urban/Rural Distribution
🔹 Quarterly Analysis (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4)
🔹 Area/Location Relation to Casualties by Day/Night

📊 The dashboard offers an in-depth view of casualty trends, road types, and crucial patterns impacting accident severity.

💼 Stakeholders benefiting from this data:
Ministry of Transport
